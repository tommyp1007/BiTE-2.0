  # --- Assets Configuration ---
  # Based on your code, you are using images and audio.
  # Ensure your project folder structure matches these paths:
  # - android/
  # - ios/
  # - lib/
  # - assets/
  #     - images/ (put .png files here)
  #     - audio/  (put .mp3 files here)
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/audio/

# --- NATIVE SPLASH CONFIGURATION ---
# This creates a solid green screen immediately when the app opens.
# We do NOT put the image here because we want the Flutter code 
# to handle the "Fade In" animation manually.
flutter_native_splash:
  color: "#2E7D32" # Matches AppColors.primary
  # image: assets/images/bite_icon2_bright.png # Commented out to allow fade-in effect
